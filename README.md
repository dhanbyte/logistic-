# FreightFlow

FreightFlow is a portfolio-grade transport management dashboard for dispatchers and freight teams. It centralizes shipments, clients, carriers and profitability in one clear operational workspace.

## Current status

FreightFlow is a published, portfolio-ready mini-TMS backed by hosted Supabase and deployed on Vercel. Visitors can create an isolated account, load a deterministic sample workspace and evaluate the complete application without local configuration. Version 1.1 adds immutable shipment status history, private transport documents and secure exports.

| Area | Status |

| Shipment CRUD, server search, filters, sorting and pagination | Production verified |

| Email/password auth, recovery and sign-out | Production verified |
| Shipment create, read, edit, status update and delete | Production verified |
| Immutable shipment status timeline with actor attribution | Production verified |
| Private transport documents in Supabase Storage | Owner/stranger/anonymous access verified locally and hosted |
| Client and carrier CRUD, ratings, statistics and related shipments | Production verified |
| Live Dashboard, Analytics and saved FX conversion | Deterministic rounding and currency invariants tested |
| GitHub Actions | Lint, types, unit tests, build, Supabase reset/lint and E2E |
| Filter-aware CSV and Print / Save as PDF order summary | Production verified |

## Tech stack

Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Supabase/PostgreSQL, Recharts, Zod, Vitest and Playwright.

## Architecture

Next.js App Router renders authenticated views and executes validated server actions. Supabase Auth owns sessions, while PostgreSQL stores profiles, clients, carriers, shipments, immutable status events and document metadata. Explicit grants, row-level security, triggers and database constraints enforce ownership, cross-tenant relationship safety, audit integrity and reporting-currency invariants independently of the UI.

Private documents upload directly from the authenticated browser to Supabase Storage; file bytes never pass through a Vercel Function. A database-backed `pending` to `ready` transition prevents incomplete uploads from being presented as complete. Financial reporting uses saved FX snapshots and deterministic server-side TypeScript aggregation appropriate for the portfolio dataset.

## Getting started

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
npx supabase start
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Without Supabase environment variables the app starts in a read-only portfolio demo mode with realistic freight data.

## Supabase setup

For local development, install Docker and run `npx supabase start`. Copy the reported API URL and publishable key to `.env.local`; all migrations are applied automatically.

For a hosted project:

1. Create and link a Supabase project with `npx supabase link`.
2. Apply every migration with `npx supabase db push`.
3. Add the project URL and publishable key to `.env.local` and Vercel.
4. Allow local and production `/auth/callback` URLs in Supabase Auth settings.

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

## Quality checks

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

The authenticated CRUD and RLS suite requires the local Supabase stack:

```powershell
npx supabase db reset
npx supabase db lint --local
$env:SUPABASE_E2E="true"
npm run test:e2e -- --workers=1
```

CI starts only the Supabase services required by Auth, Storage, PostgREST and PostgreSQL, resets the database from migrations, lints the schema and runs Playwright serially for repeatability.

## Data security

Every business record is owned by a Supabase Auth user. PostgreSQL row-level security and explicit table grants isolate profiles, clients, carriers, shipments, status events and document metadata. Cross-user relationships are rejected, profile updates are column-limited, and database triggers preserve reporting-currency, FX snapshot and status-history integrity.

The `shipment-documents` bucket is private. Object policies require an owned shipment and matching pending metadata, while finalization verifies the stored object before exposing it as ready. The application uses authenticated Storage requests only: no public URLs, `service_role` key or file proxy. CSV export runs under the caller's RLS session, preserves active filters and neutralizes formula-like text values.

## Deployment

Production runs on Vercel with a hosted Supabase project. Vercel stores only the public project URL and publishable client key; privileged Supabase keys are not used by the application. Auth permits the exact production callback plus local development callbacks. GitHub Actions validates linting, types, unit tests, the production build and the complete local-Supabase E2E suite.

## Known limitations

`npm audit` currently reports no high or critical vulnerabilities and two moderate findings in the PostCSS version bundled by the latest stable Next.js 16.2.10. The automated fix would downgrade Next.js to 9.3.3, so it is intentionally not applied; the advisory should be revisited when a safe stable upgrade is available.

The hosted project currently uses Supabase's default email service. Password recovery was verified end to end for the project owner's authorized address, but a custom SMTP provider would be required for dependable delivery to arbitrary public addresses.

Document uploads intentionally accept only declared PDF/JPEG/PNG MIME types up to 6 MiB. The portfolio deployment does not include antivirus scanning, content-signature inspection or resumable uploads. Save as PDF uses the browser print engine rather than generating a signed archival PDF on the server.

## Demo

Live demo: [freight-flow-tau.vercel.app](https://freight-flow-tau.vercel.app).

1. Create an account with any email and a password of at least eight characters.
2. Select **Load sample workspace** on the empty Dashboard.
3. Explore ten realistic shipments, four clients and four carriers across PLN, EUR and USD.

Every account receives a private workspace protected by RLS. Sample data is created atomically for that user only, can be loaded once into an empty workspace and never exposes another visitor's records. No shared demo password is stored in the repository.
